Cacoon CLI

---

It's a very simple wrapper for list, create, get, and delete [diagram](https://developer.nulab-inc.com/docs/cacoo/api/1/diagrams/). BTW, Spring style API bring me a lot of memories for my first job in 7 years ago.

# Suggestions

- According to it's an operation for object. API following [HTTP method](https://restfulapi.net/http-methods/) could make more sense
- Put authentication token into header
- Get contents has some problem...maybe I'm using it in the wrong way
- Expose diagram editing or upload API will have better integrability
- SVG could be a good alternative for XML for more flexible and graphical control
